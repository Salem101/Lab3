For this Lab I had to decide which languages to use. I decided to go with 2 languages that I'm somewhat familiar with. Java and Python. 
Transitioning from one language to the next wasn't easy. First I gathered the basic concepts down. 
Then I used Java, the language which is more familiar to me to write the source code and compile to make sure it works and there were no errors. 
I also had to make sure there were no errors with getting the input from the user. 
Next, I tried to translate the code from Java to Python but it unexpected turned out a bit more difficult than I expected.
So having known the code I was going to write. I coded in Python from scratch. 
I think for the future I need to work on a smoother transition from one language to the next. Or else it can waste a lot of time rewriting it.
The most difficult part what the syntax difference of each program. 
Where java uses many semicolons, and is way more lengthy. 
Python is more concise and is very simple, besides for a few colons. 
It worked for this time because the code was short and concise.
