I wrote the bubble Sort in both Java & Python. 
I asked user for number of elements in their list they wanted to sort. 
Then I asked for user input for each of the elements. 
I printed the element before and after the bubble sort for user to see that it worked. 

Steps: 
Review and familiarize with the algorithm before writing the code. 
Figure out the transition from the first language (java) to second language (python).
