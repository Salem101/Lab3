PseudoCode for Bubble Sort: 
Bubble Sort sorts by comparing elements and sort from left to right where the left side has the lesser value and the right side has the greater value. 
For the Bubble Sort algorithm a basic series of steps are completed until the elements are sorted: 
  1. Select first element and second element. 
  2. Compare values. 
  3. If left value is greater then swap with right value. 
  4. If right value is greater then don't do anything. 
  5. Move on to second and third value. 
  6. repeat steps 2-4. 
  7. Use this process until all elements are sorted. 
Happy Bubble Sorting!
